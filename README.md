## Build instructions
Type `./build.sh` or `chmod u+x ./build.sh && ./build.sh` to run the script, which downloads, copies and renames all textures. Use MSYS2 if you're on Windows. You may skip certain steps that the script performs if you already have the necessary files at hand:

- **Skip downloading:** Create empty folders named `OoT-Reloaded` and `MM-Reloaded`
- **Skip file copying:** Create a directory called `OOT+MM COMBO` that contains both `THE LEGEND OF ZELDA` and `ZELDA MAJORA'S MASK` folders with all the HD textures inside

The operation for renaming files will take some time to finish, with no progress being displayed.
